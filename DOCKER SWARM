Docker nodes that are not part of a swarm are said to be in single-engine mode.

# To add Docker node on swarm mode:

docker swarm init

# To add a manager to this swarm, run following command:

docker swarm join-token manager

# To check swarm node list:

docker node ls

# To join swarm mode 

docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-10piz2kmwyag6cobpbk4t-6myhjiqunfcq467us14hfm07w 192.168.40.129:2377

When you run docker swarm init command it will show a join link for worker nodes like above.

# To add a manager to this swarm, run the following command:

docker swarm join-token manager

docker swarm join --token ABC-----XYZ 192.168.40.129:2377

; run following command on docker node to make worker.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token token_with_IP_Address

# To SHOW Token for Worker Node:

docker swarm join-token -q worker

docker swarm join-token worker

# DOCKER SERVICE:

docker service create --name First_service --replicas 6 -p 80:80 zohaibdodo/first-docker-app

# To update:

docker service update First_service


if docker image is not found on docker instance then service will not create container on that instance.
